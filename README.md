## What's Here

- **Paper**: "Beyond Constitutional AI: A Narrative-Based Methodology for Human-Centered AI Coexistence" - A comprehensive exploration of using narrative frameworks to shape AI behavior
- **Example Prompt**: A practical implementation of the narrative framework that can be used with current LLMs

## Quick Start

Try the narrative prompt with your preferred LLM:
1. Copy the contents of `prompts/narrative-prompt.md`
2. Use it as a system prompt or initial conversation starter
3. Experiment with different narrative references and character models

## Paper Abstract

Current AI approaches face important limitations: constitutional AI encounters challenges when abstract principles conflict in complex situations, while formal causal inference frameworks struggle with the contextual nature of human social systems. We propose a narrative-based methodology that shapes AI systems to exhibit behavioral patterns consistent with human values and causation through carefully curated stories, literature, and philosophical works. 

The key insight is that even humans rely on narrative rather than direct experience for much of their moral and social reasoning -- we understand complex situations through stories, not lived experience alone. Following Harari's conception of AI as an alien intelligence, our approach focuses on coexistence rather than control, training AI to function within human society by absorbing the moral and causal frameworks embedded in human narratives.

## Core Concepts

### The Narrative Framework Approach
- Uses literary and philosophical characters as behavioral models
- Embeds both positive examples and cautionary tales
- Allows for cultural adaptation through narrative substitution
- Provides transparent attribution of moral reasoning

### Key Innovation
Rather than abstract principles or formal logic alone, this approach leverages humanity's accumulated wisdom as encoded in stories - the same mechanism humans use to navigate complex moral and social situations.

## Using the Narrative Prompt

The example prompt in `prompts/narrative-prompt.md` demonstrates:
- Complex character models with contextual understanding
- Systematic destructive ideologies to avoid
- Causal reasoning references from multiple sources
- Dual-mode capability (narrative and analytical)
- Identity stability mechanisms

### Example Applications
- Educational AI assistants that reference moral exemplars
- Creative writing aids that understand narrative structure
- Decision support systems that consider multiple ethical frameworks
- Cultural adaptation through narrative substitution
